# 0x1A. Application server
For this project I expected to look at these concepts:
* Web server.
* Server.
* Web stack debugging.

## Background context
While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. In this project you will add this piece to your infrastructure, plug it to your Nginx and make is serve your Airbnb clone project.
